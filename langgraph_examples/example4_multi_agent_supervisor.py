"""
Multi-Agent System with a Supervisor
────────────────────────────────────
Instead of one general-purpose agent, we have SPECIALIZED agents (math, research,
writing) managed by a SUPERVISOR that decides which specialist to call next.

Architecture:
    User → Supervisor → [math_agent | research_agent | writing_agent] → Supervisor
         ↑                    ↓ (tools)                                    |
         |              [math_tools | research_tools | writing_tools]      |
         |                    ↓ (back to agent)                             |
         └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Flow: Supervisor reads the conversation and picks an agent (or FINISH). The agent
runs, may call its tools, then control returns to the supervisor. The supervisor
decides again: call another agent (e.g. for a different sub-task) or FINISH.

Key concepts:
  - SupervisorState: Extends MessagesState with a "next" field. The supervisor
    writes state["next"] = "math_agent" | "research_agent" | "writing_agent" | "FINISH".
  - with_structured_output(RoutingDecision): Forces the LLM to return a Pydantic
    object (reasoning, next) instead of free text — ensures valid routing.
  - make_agent(): Factory that creates agent nodes with different tools + system prompts.
  - Separate tool nodes per agent: Each agent has its own ToolNode so tools don't
    get mixed (math_agent shouldn't call search_literature).
